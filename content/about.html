I'm **Ally**, a twenty-something geek from a big city. I study *molecular &amp; cellular biology* at a university and also study *anthropology* to nurture my interest in the humanities.  

Elsewhere, you can find me on [github](https://github.com/spo11), [deviantART](http://spliceosome.deviantart.com), and [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/kalikoke). 

### Code
I learned how to program in various languages. Of the scripting languages, I have the most proficiency in *python* and *ruby*. Web-wise, I can code in *php*, *html/css*.  

### Network
When I'm not studying or writing code, I tinker with a web server I built using an old computer.

### Computer Setup
I'm neither a Mac nor Windows person. My laptop at the moment has [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) installed. I try to keep a very light setup with the [subtle](http://subtle.subforge.org) window manager. 

### This Site
I couldn't think of anything creative to name the site, so I came up with *Artemis*, which, if you're familiar with recombination events, is a nuclease involved in V(D)J recombination events. That I named this site after an enzyme is a testament of my nerdiness. :-)
