::Evil laughter::. No, I've not gone mad. I was always mad. My mental issues aside, I recently took an interest in static website generators (which may seem like something from the '90s), When I refer to *Jekyll* and *Hyde*, I mean the static website generators. 

Reading Tom Preston's post on [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) inspired me to **bake** my own site using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). However, Jekyll didn't have certain features I wanted on my own site, so I took a look at [Hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) and switched this site over to that.

### What I Wanted
* A navigation menu that could show active and inactive states (like on this site)
* Easy maintenance &amp; configuration
* Static pages (for faster performance)
* Tags

### What Hyde Offers Over Jekyll
If you look past the caning incident, my buddy Ed Hyde ain't so bad. Sure, he's violent and generally unpleasant and not exactly an upholder of moral standards, but whatever. 

Now back to this baked website thing. (I couldn't resist referencing *The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, sorry).  

I really liked using Jekyll as a minimalist yet extensible website generator, but I wanted a little more. Hyde has support built-in for tagging posts, something which Jekyll has as well but in my opinion doesn't handle as efficiently as Hyde. Cosmetically, I also appreciated that I could use a navigation menu that could display active/inactive states (I realize this may seem trivial to some people, but I find it's a great way to keep track of where I am on a site). 

### The Switching Process
They may seem remarkably different on the outside, but in reality Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. These generators accomplish the same thing using a different language (Jekyll uses ruby, whereas Hyde uses python).

Switching didn't require that I back up a MySQL database or any complicated configuration files. All I needed to do was transfer my blog posts to a folder and change the frontmatter a bit, and I was done.

### To be continued
In the next part, I'll write on the steps of setting up a hyde site.
